# The Next Deployment - Game Design Document

### ***Summary***: <br>
You are a lieutenant leading a collection of squads on their next deployment cycle. It is your job to restore the community in the allotted time frame to satisfactory conditions. Manage your men, the materials you brought, the materials of the community, and your own dreams of success to make it out of this next deployment.<br><br>

### ***Story***: <br>
You wake up in the med bay after a bad last deployment where your choices cost a lot of your brother's lives. You have been assigned a duty away from the front lines to prove your merits as a leader and manager.<br>

Assigned to a run down community that was hit hard by both GAR and Separatist forces, your task is to get the community up and running again. You are given a few squads of men to assist you in this task. These men are like you, bred for war and annoyed that they now have to pick up droid parts, build houses, and farm fields.<br>

You can rush the process, check the list off so high command is happy and issues you a new rotation, but at the possible cost to the community. If you don't listen and work with them, the experts of the land, you may choose houses that will not whether their storms, crops that will not sustain them or are of good trade value. You rushing to get out of there may leave live ordinances in the ground that could injure or destroy the community after you leave.<br>

Working with the community will take time, time to piece together what they are saying with the limited translator bots both of you have. Time to build things right, prepare the ground and set building posts. Time to sweep the fields for debris fully. It will take doing to manage your men to have them temper themselves to submit to this work too, but also not over work themselves and risk injury or running out of supplies.<br>

Finding the middle ground is the best way to appease both the community and the high command, but that balance is hard to do. The choice between leaving the community vulnerable and risking the status/rank of you and your men is hard. Your actions through this next deployment don't just affect you… so what choice are you going to make?
